This paper presents the design and development of an adaptive AI agent system based on the Six Thinking Hats methodology. The research explores how AI can be designed to empower rather than replace human cognition, specifically focusing on enhancing student agency and critical thinking in higher education contexts. The system includes six AI personas (Analyst, Empath, Critic, Optimist, Innovator, Conductor) and incorporates bias-nudge mechanisms and explainable interaction strategies to mitigate over-reliance and strengthen ethical transparency.
